Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Project (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using MS Excel)
### **Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Project**  

#### **Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to analyze **hospital emergency room (ER) data** to improve patient flow, optimize resource allocation, and enhance service efficiency. By designing an **interactive dashboard**, we aim to provide actionable insights into:  
- Patient **admission trends**  
- **Waiting time analysis**  
- **Satisfaction levels**  
- **Demographic insights**  
- **Referral patterns**  

This project helps hospital administrators and healthcare professionals make **data-driven decisions** to enhance the **patient experience** and **operational efficiency.**  
#### **Dataset Used:**  
The dataset consists of hospital ER records

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
 **1. Number of Patients:**  
- Tracks the **total number of ER visits per day.**  
- Visualized using an **area sparkline chart** to spot **busy days and seasonal trends.**  
- Helps hospitals **predict peak hours** and optimize **staffing schedules.**  

 **2. Average Wait Time:**  
- Calculates the **average waiting time before seeing a doctor.**  
- Highlights **days with excessive wait times** that might indicate **staffing issues or operational bottlenecks.**  
- Helps **reduce patient frustration and improve service efficiency.**  

 **3. Patient Satisfaction Score:**  
- Tracks the **average daily satisfaction score** given by patients.  
- Helps **monitor service quality and patient experience.**  
- Visualized with an **area sparkline chart** to **identify patterns and drops in satisfaction** that may correlate with delays or other challenges.

### **Process of Building the Dashboard:**  

#### **Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning**  
- Import data into **Excel**  
- Remove duplicates and handle missing values  
- Convert timestamps to **readable date-time format**  
- Categorize data (e.g., Age Groups, Admission Status)  

#### **Step 2: KPI Calculation**  
**ðŸ”¹ Number of Patients**  
- Count total patients visiting the ER per day  
- Use an **area sparkline** to track **daily trends**  

**ðŸ”¹ Average Wait Time**  
- Calculate the **mean wait time per day**  
- Identify days with **higher wait times** for improvements  

**ðŸ”¹ Patient Satisfaction Score**  
- Find the **average satisfaction score per day**  
- Use a **sparkline chart** to analyze trends and detect drops  

**ðŸ”¹ Patient Admission Status**  
- Calculate **% of admitted vs. not admitted**  
- Use a **bar chart** to visualize the comparison  

**ðŸ”¹ Gender-Wise Analysis**  
- Find the percentage of **male vs. female** patients  
- Use a **donut chart** to represent gender distribution  

**ðŸ”¹ Patient Attend Status**  
- Track **on-time vs. delayed** cases  
- Use a **pie chart** to show proportions  

**ðŸ”¹ Referral to Departments**  
- Count patients referred to different **hospital departments**  
- Use a **bar chart** to highlight the most visited departments  

#### **Step 3: Dashboard Creation**  
- Use **Pivot Tables and Charts** in Excel  
- Apply **conditional formatting** for better visibility  
- Add **interactive slicers** for month-wise filtering  
- Ensure **easy navigation** with buttons and labels
