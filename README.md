Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Project (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using MS Excel)
### **Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Project**  

#### **Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to analyze **hospital emergency room (ER) data** to improve patient flow, optimize resource allocation, and enhance service efficiency. By designing an **interactive dashboard**, we aim to provide actionable insights into:  
- Patient **admission trends**  
- **Waiting time analysis**  
- **Satisfaction levels**  
- **Demographic insights**  
- **Referral patterns**  

This project helps hospital administrators and healthcare professionals make **data-driven decisions** to enhance the **patient experience** and **operational efficiency.**  
#### **Dataset Used:**  
The dataset consists of hospital ER records

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
 **1. Number of Patients:**  
- Tracks the **total number of ER visits per day.**  
- Visualized using an **area sparkline chart** to spot **busy days and seasonal trends.**  
- Helps hospitals **predict peak hours** and optimize **staffing schedules.**  

 **2. Average Wait Time:**  
- Calculates the **average waiting time before seeing a doctor.**  
- Highlights **days with excessive wait times** that might indicate **staffing issues or operational bottlenecks.**  
- Helps **reduce patient frustration and improve service efficiency.**  

 **3. Patient Satisfaction Score:**  
- Tracks the **average daily satisfaction score** given by patients.  
- Helps **monitor service quality and patient experience.**  
- Visualized with an **area sparkline chart** to **identify patterns and drops in satisfaction** that may correlate with delays or other challenges.
